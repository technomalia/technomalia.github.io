# Welcome to Technomalia!

Alright I've gone and registered a proper domain for the group's site, since they're dirt cheap and make us look that little more professional: though the new domain hasn't fully populated the DNS lookup servers yet, I've just had it pop in Microsofts Edge browser on my phone, so the other browsers should be catching-up soon enough now, which means there's no longer the need to use a cheap-looking subdomain of githubs when linking or visiting the site:

<a href="http://technomalia.org">technomalia.org</a> <-- That's us!

I didn't bother buying an SSL certificate to encrypt the site too, which slightly annoys me because I'm <b>SO</b> accustomed to ALL my pages/domains/sites having that sexy little green padlock nowadays, but i dunno - it'll probably bug me enough that I end up grabbing a certificate too I guess.

If you're a group member who's unsure what you should do now you're here, <i>start</i> by giving your feedback - tell us how you think our site should look or feel and what is wrong/right about it and incidentally - the dog silhouette logo is just a spur of the moment scribble to fill in until we've got a better one, unless we don't create a better one which is fine too I don't care, long as shit's gettin' <i>done</i> and not just discussed.

Here's the proposed site-map I've got so far:

```
Technomalia

Articles -> Cloud Computing
         -> Raspberry Pi
         -> Machine Learning
         -> ???

Products -> SmartPet-20(20) [Product Intro .. Product Image .. Product Features .. Product Specs]

Information -> About Technomalia
            -> Meet the Team
            -> Resource Links
```
Really, I've gotta get an open line of communication going with Tara: waiting until the group sessions leaves a lot of days without any back and forth at all and it's hard to design or construct anything with a combination of 50/50 input from two people if those two people are only comparing notes twice a week - we should be able to present a functional site by Tuesday, yet Tuesday will be the first opportunity we've had to even collaborate about it.

Everyone else, I can just copy/paste their reports or writing into the site and neaten it, but without the visual design half of the site creation I don't know what I'll be looking at in a week.

I know there's the four 1,200 word reports everyone's doing, but do we want them all just shoved in the one page or a separate page for each?

Tell me what other pages you'll need while I'll have a look for a better menu-bar before bedtime Sunday night.

Dreamweaver is <i>broken</i>.. 

I'll have to hand-edit the site into creation with just Atom to edit all the files and firefox to preview those edits. 

Fukn arsehole of an application and I've been to the Adobe forums: found a page <b>packed</b> will users screaming about having the same shitty pauses in their Dreamweaver installations that last from 5 seconds to several minutes - every time you type anything, the entire app freezes for a few seconds, then what you've typed appears in the code editor and the cursor blinks again so you type a few characters and it instantly freezes for another 5 seconds then the cursor is back again, rinse and repeat over and over.. 

Unusuable, it is and all the screaming from users in the forums isn't from 2018 or some distant time years in the past - it's <u>ALL</u> from June through to the start of this month - with no replies from Adobe whatsoever.

The rest of the ```2020``` suite of apps still work fine,  but ```Dreamweaver``` is ratshit until they pull their heads out their arses and give us an update, so I've got none of the speed and convenience of the all-in-one super site builder.

Adobe have never been known for their fast response to their own customers complaints though and I'm not getting anything done complaining about it myself..
