# Welcome to Technomalia!

You have found your way our RMIT study-group's website, which exists purely as an assignment exercise to showcase our teams remarkable level of awesome - both individual and group assets - and to demonstrate that awesome with the various tasks and assessments we'll be given from now until the end of the Introduction to Information Technology course.

If you're a group member who's unsure what you should do now you're here, <i>definitely</i> begin with giving your feedback - tell us how you think our site should look or feel and what is wrong/right about it so far.

One of the most important things we need to decide is how many pages we want and what each of those pages will contain or be about.

So far I've only considered the landing page, which doesn't necessarily have to be titled "Home", but every site needs one and I know we'll need a few more for the various exercises assignment-02 has us all doing but I'm unsure of the number of individual pages we'll need and how many will hold multiple topics/exercises, so help me by telling me if you need a full page for what you're working on.

So far these are the only two pages I <b>know</b> we will need:

- Home
- Reports -> 01 -> 02 -> 03 -> 04
- Products -+ Hardware -> SmartPet-20(20)
            | Software -> (none)
            | Services -> (none)
- ...
- About

I know there's the four 1,200 word reports everyone's doing, but do we want them all just shoved in the one page or a seperate page for each?

Tell me what other pages you'll need.
