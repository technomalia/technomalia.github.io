              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">The purpose of the group's formation was the over-arching lesson from this unit in Information Technology: to learn how to work together in a team with other people and though we succeeded in some respects, we also failed dismally in aspects of team-work - collaboration being foremost in my mind as I type this out now, sitting here and I doubt Joanne or Shane would be able to disagree with me on that point.</p>
							<!-- <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">While we got our work done (some of us at the last minute, <i>just</i> managing to squeeze in by a hair) for Assignment-02, Assignment-03 and 05 presented us with complications we'd not foreseen: namely our lack of experience actually collaborating together on tasks, which worked fine for the first month of the group's existence though failed us a fair degree in this last few weeks just gone because we would simply take a task each and go off to do it solo.</p> -->

This stems from being introduced to Technology as a child with video games such as Nintendo’s Game Boy, Donkey Kong and later with her first mobile phone in 1999 – a Sony Ericson flip!</p>

While out there, he reached the decision that he'd be making a major shift in his mode of living, which he did: ultimately keeping a comprehensive online photo diary of his time with the wildlife that can be found <a style="border-radius: 6px; background-color: #0260FF; color: #FFF; padding: 6px" href="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/category/rainforest/"><b>here</b></a> and this extended camping life inevitably rolled-on a year longer than he'd planned, in which time he grew so well aquainted with local fauna he'd assigned the animal visitors to his make-shift camp individual names and ate dinner with them every night.</p>

          		<p align="left" style="padding-left: 33px; padding-right: 33px; font-size: 1.22rem; color: rgba(190, 230, 255, 0.9); text-shadow: 0px 2px 1px #000">Posessing a finely developed aptitude for visual design and such a deep appreciation for beauty that's all he cares to see in this world, Jason has assumed the roles of creative-director and web-developer on behalf of the group and has designed all the visual components required by Technomalia for the duration of of the course: from the site and everythng on it, to all illustrations and visuals, to imagining up the SmartPet-20's features, functionality and design, construction - <i>yeah</i> - he <u>really</u> wishes he'd had someone to work <i>with</i> on all that creativity because it would've made the entire study period much more productive, inspiring and fun, but he ended-up doing most of the thinking, designing and invention on his own while the others all did their, "research".</p>

In school he used the Apple IIE and then went on to use a Pentium home tower he built himself. During this time saw the world transform from dial-up internet to broadband and now NBN. All the changes have kept Jason interestred and having already accumulated a lifetime of generalized knowledge about the world of technology a university degree seemed like the most natural extension of that.</p>

          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Tara left the course like a loser and did so just days before our largest assignment was due: while she cited the fact she was all sad and boohoo about life then tried to attribute <i>that</i> to the fact COVID-19 has Melbourne in lockdown still, the flat truth is that many other people are just as isolated and many other people are less than happy about the current situation.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">End of the day, everyone is depressed - welcome to life on planet fucking earth mate: the rest of us manage to get ourselves out of bed each day and more or less function while you have simply let the group down right at the last minute and dumped all your work on us to do because you're a failure and that's about all we ended up thinking of you as you left.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">You feel comfortable with that? Feel alright with knowing that all four of us have no respect for your self-pity, or that none of us even saw a glimmer of talent if the two months you ho-hummed your way through a few ugly layouts and shitty excuses for design?</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">You have fun feeling sorry for yourself anyhow: we'll do the design, submit the assignment and whether we lose marks because it's not done as well as it could've been with a full group or not at least we stayed with it regardless how boring, how difficult, how rushed or how confused we might've become at various points and we will finish the unit because we're not weak-as-piss fuckups like you and we actually care about letting our team and ourselves down.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">You never once contributed anything worth looking at anyway: it isn't like the group hinged on you and your gobsmacking lack of talent or ability, that's for sure.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">I really have no idea how the fuck you could've successfully completed a fashion design degree and having now witnessed how vapid and lacking in character you really are I don't believe you ever did.</p>

              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">Although there are variables or nuances within each predominate type being Assertive or Turbulent that can influence an individual’s actions or emotions, the underlying predominate type remains central to the core personality trait.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">The predominate personality types also fall into one of four core definitions that may either be Analysts (guided by logic), Diplomats (guided by principles), Sentinels (guided by practicality) or Explorers (guided by excitement).</p>

              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">As you can see in the above diagram, despite our team members falling into only three personality types, our team is well balanced across the four core definitions.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">This balance of team members has a high potential for success when working together.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">This team will likely see Tara and Annisa with exceptional communicative and creative skills being complemented by the energetic traits of Jason and Joanne to run with ideas and add their own special influence to such creations, before being balanced overall by the also creative but logical nature of Shane.</p>
