              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Starting with a full group of six members, our study regime coupled with the effects of COVID-19 has seen the group gradually eroded away to the mere three active students we currently have and will see-out the end of the course with.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">The purpose of the group's formation was the over-arching lesson from this unit in Information Technology: to learn how to work together in a team with other people and though we succeeded in some respects, we also failed dismally in aspects of team-work - collaboration being foremost in my mind as I type this out now, sitting here and I doubt Joanne or Shane would be able to disagree with me on that point.</p>
							<!-- <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">While we got our work done (some of us at the last minute, <i>just</i> managing to squeeze in by a hair) for Assignment-02, Assignment-03 and 05 presented us with complications we'd not foreseen: namely our lack of experience actually collaborating together on tasks, which worked fine for the first month of the group's existence though failed us a fair degree in this last few weeks just gone because we would simply take a task each and go off to do it solo.</p> -->

          		<h2 style="color: #FFF" align="left">Joanne</h2>
              <!-- <p align="left" class="lead">Student Number: s3868544</p> -->
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Joanne is remarkable.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">The range of personal qualities this woman has brought to our group astonishes me.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">From the very first day, she would switch to whatever role the team needed at the time; from diplomat, to team leader, to co-worker, to friend and always be organizing <i>us</i> at the same time as she maintained her own very high quality work..</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">The number of times she's stepped in to neutralize minor disputes before they've escalated to restore peace; encouraged members of the team and given direction during moments where everyone in the group were drawing blank faces instead of ideas; the way she'd take the initiative in emailing the group with accouncements, or contact our tutor to clarity some question on our behalf and all this while allowing us all to bask - like lizards on a rock - in the warmth, honestly, intelligence and humour of a personality that managed to keep the group calm simply by being there.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Brilliant, engaging and dynamic - Joanne is easily the <b>most</b> valuable member of the group.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Anyway, she currently works in the gift and homewares industry as an account manager but is looking to move into Information Technology since she's always been interested in technology so where better to begin that transition, than studying for a degree with RMIT.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Joanne studied Fashion Design at Tafe NSW and is naturally a creative person however prefers to use that creativity in cooking and home décor.  Joanne adores her pet Cat, Daisy despite the constant bite marks.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Her interest in IT is for convenience, social connectivity and entertainment through the likes of Google Maps, Facebook and Netflix. This stems from being introduced to Technology as a child with video games such as Nintendo’s Game Boy, Donkey Kong and later with her first mobile phone in 1999 – a Sony Ericson flip!</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Studying at RMIT is Joanne’s first step in shifting into the IT Industry and despite limited existing knowledge about the subject, is looking forward to the journey with her Class Group – Technomalia.</p>

           		<h2 style="color: #FFF" align="left">Jason</h2>
          		<!-- <p align="left" class="lead">Student Number: s3468152</p> -->
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">After the emotional trauma of seperating from an ex-girlfriend of five years in Adelaide several years ago, Jason decided to move to the Blue Mountains and live in the national park for a few months to reset his brain and reached the decision while "out there" that he'd be making a major shift in his mode of living, which he certainly did: ultimately keeping a comprehensive, online photo diary of his time with the wildlife that can be found <a style="border-radius: 6px; background-color: #0260FF; color: #FFF; padding: 6px" href="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/category/rainforest/"><b>here</b></a> and ended-up rolling-on an additional year to what he'd planned, in which time he grew so well aquainted with local fauna he'd assigned the animal visitors to his make-shift camp individual names and ate dinner with them every night.</p>
          		
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Following this feral rainforest escapade, Jason found he'd aquired a deep interest and prociciency for <i>writing</i> and still now finds it <u><b>the purest</b></u>, most direct form of self-expression: with five years maintaining the website he began simply to document the period of wild living previously mentioned, Jason still writes regularly in a generalized online diary available to anyone and located in a sub-directory of his site <a style="border-radius: 6px; background-color: #0260FF; color: #FFF; padding: 6px" href="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/sandbox/words/diaries/2020/"><b>https://psychaesthetic.com.au</b></a> where he still pours private thoughts to a public webpage - all the thoughts most people do their very best to hide, in fact.</p>
          		
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Posessing a very well developed aptitude for visual arts, design and with a very well-tuned "eye" for aesthetics, Jason has assumed the roles of both creative-director and web-developer for the group and has designed every creative component the group has reqired for the duration of it's existence: from the site and everythng on it, to all illustrations, colour-themes and visuals, to imagining up the SmartPet-20 and SpartPet-Plus's features, functionality and look, feel, construction - <i>everything</i> - and yeah while he <u>really</u> wishes he'd had someone work <i>with</i> him on all those creative processes because it would've made the entire group much more productive, inspiring and fun, he ended-up having to do all the thinking, designing and inventing on his own while the others all did - whatever..</p> 
          		
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Jason received a Commodore VIC20 for Christmas when he was 13 and since then was hooked on IT. In school he used the Apple IIE and then went on to use a Pentium home tower he built himself. During this time saw the world transform from dial-up internet to broadband and now NBN. All the changes have kept Jason interestred and having already accumulated a lifetime of generalized knowledge about the world of technology a university degree seemed like the most natural extension of that.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Why the <b>hell</b> am I writing about <i>myself</i> in the third-person? When have I <i>ever</i> done that?</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD"></p>

          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Shane is from Newcastle, NSW and is a painter by trade but has been working in coal mines for the last 11 years but looking for a career shift into IT. Not new to studying as has previously almost completed a combined BBUS/BCOMM degree with Newcastle University. Now that he has the time to study again has observed the potential opportunity within the IT industry offers so decided this was the move to made, instead of completing the BBUS/BCOMM degrees.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Loves spending time with family and friends and is super excited about his eldest boy getting started in Soccer as he very much enjoyed sports as a youngster.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Shane is excited to think of what the future holds for us considering what we have achieved so far in IT, and for the endless possibilities and opportunities to come.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">IT interest grew over the years after seeing new gadgets coming onto the market nearly as quickly as a previous model sold out. And with every new model brought to market, was new innovative technologies that would change the world.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">With no experience in IT related work, however I believe that given the right training, he too, can achieve wonderful things in this world.</p>

          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">After completing High School in 2017, Annisa enrolled into an Advanced Diploma of Aeronautical Engineering with RMIT but switched to Bachelor of Information Technology this year, also with RMIT.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Annisa was interested in IT while trying to decide if she should continue the Advanced Diploma of Aeronautical Engineering. Being exposed to the world of programming and IT since a young age, as her father works as a software developer. So, while figuring out where the interests lay career-wise, she became intrigued with her father’s work, as it had all sorts of code and required problem solving skills which lead her to choose to study IT. career development*</p>

          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">Tara left the course like a loser and did so just days before our largest assignment was due: while she cited the fact she was all sad and boohoo about life then tried to attribute <i>that</i> to the fact COVID-19 has Melbourne in lockdown still, the flat truth is that many other people are just as isolated and many other people are less than happy about the current situation.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">End of the day, everyone is depressed - welcome to life on planet fucking earth mate: the rest of us manage to get ourselves out of bed each day and more or less function while you have simply let the group down right at the last minute and dumped all your work on us to do because you're a failure and that's about all we ended up thinking of you as you left.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">You feel comfortable with that? Feel alright with knowing that all four of us have no respect for your self-pity, or that none of us even saw a glimmer of talent if the two months you ho-hummed your way through a few ugly layouts and shitty excuses for design?</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">You have fun feeling sorry for yourself anyhow: we'll do the design, submit the assignment and whether we lose marks because it's not done as well as it could've been with a full group or not at least we stayed with it regardless how boring, how difficult, how rushed or how confused we might've become at various points and we will finish the unit because we're not weak-as-piss fuckups like you and we actually care about letting our team and ourselves down.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">You never once contributed anything worth looking at anyway: it isn't like the group hinged on you and your gobsmacking lack of talent or ability, that's for sure.</p>
          		<p align="left" style="font-size: 1.22rem; color: #DDD">I really have no idea how the fuck you could've successfully completed a fashion design degree and having now witnessed how vapid and lacking in character you really are I don't believe you ever did.</p>

              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">Of 16 possible personality types according to Myers-Briggs, our five team members fall into only three predominate types being the Logician, Mediator and Virtuoso types.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">Although there are variables or nuances within each predominate type being Assertive or Turbulent that can influence an individual’s actions or emotions, the underlying predominate type remains central to the core personality trait.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">The predominate personality types also fall into one of four core definitions that may either be Analysts (guided by logic), Diplomats (guided by principles), Sentinels (guided by practicality) or Explorers (guided by excitement).</p>

              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">As you can see in the above diagram, despite our team members falling into only three personality types, our team is well balanced across the four core definitions.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">This balance of team members has a high potential for success when working together.</p>
              <p align="left" style="font-weight: 250">This team will likely see Tara and Annisa with exceptional communicative and creative skills being complemented by the energetic traits of Jason and Joanne to run with ideas and add their own special influence to such creations, before being balanced overall by the also creative but logical nature of Shane.</p>
