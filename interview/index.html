            <p align="center">For this activity, Joanne volunteered herself to interview a work colleague she already works with so after a quick discussion we came to an agreement on a list of questions for her to ask after which she arranged lunch with co-worker - Rael - then met up and conducted the interview on everyone's behalf.</p>
            <p align="center">This page contains both the audio and rather large transcription of Joanne's interview -  the write-up can be found in our submission PDF:</p>

          <div width="100%" style="padding: 0.11rem 0.11rem; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)">
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Rael Dusheiko is the CIO at a consumer goods business in Rosebery, Sydney called Sunnylife Group Pty Ltd. Sunnylife Australia is the brand and they sell gift and homewares goods directly to consumers via the brands 4 websites in Australia, UK, Europe and the USA as well as through a large wholesale network globally. There are 3 offices including Sydney, London and Los Angeles.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Sunnylife has 3 related companies including Sunnylife Australia, BullAnt Logistics and Mr & Mrs Jones. Mr & Mrs Jones was recently put into administration and is now exclusively trading online but was previously a ‘bricks and mortar’ retail store chain.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">The Gift & Homewares industry is reliant on the retail store space, whether it be online or a physical store. Both of which require consumers to spend to be successful. The consumers spend more during times of cultural celebrations (for example, Christmas) and during Summer months. </p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><b><u>The Work</u></b></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Rael overseas all ‘Technology’ regarding all three companies</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">A Combination of doing the work in house and managing relationships with third party partners. The in-house work is mainly software related as this is where Rael’s skills lie. The Infrastructure, Security, Internet, Connectivity is all outsourced. Rael manages the relationships with those partners. </p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Other work includes Reporting, Business Processes, Tech Support, Documentation, Training, Counselling and Office all rounder as Rael has been in the business a long time. </p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><b><u>Interactions</u></b></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Rael deals with everyone in the company and its generally technology related. Everyone from the owners to the pick and packers at the warehouse. Adapting his language so people from all levels of the business can understand the conversation. This type of communication is a key part of Rael’s job and his best skill. Being bilingual English – Tech speak. </p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Rael works with Developers, Sales Team, Production Team, Purchasing Team. The interactions are more about how to help them get their job done and less about their actual job. People are often frustrated and impatient due to a lack of understanding.  Most people are not IT professionals. Rael thinks of his colleagues as his clients.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Rael has little interactions with other IT professionals aside from networking events. He finds IT professionals to be far more Technical than he is and find that he does not have much in common with them. 2 friends work in  IT, one in sales at Microsoft and the other is a Lawyer.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><hr></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><b><u>Spending Time</u></b></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">1) Majority of time managing processes around exceptional events regarding operations that are not a traditional business transaction, not necessarily technology related.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">2) Improving business processes through technology that is then either worked on by the team, or outsourced.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><hr></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"><b><u>Challenges</u></b></p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"> - The trade off between budget, time and requirements</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%"> - Managing the outsourced partners to be appreciate the urgency of specific issues facing the business. </p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Rael believes that the essence of the IT industry is using Technology to make peoples lives easier. Technology is a means to and end is not an end in of itself. Many technologists forget what they need to do by getting caught up in the technology itself.</p>
            <p align="left" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 110%">Example within Sunnylife and how our servers are set up – any employee globally, has access to any file at any time in an instant.</p>

          <!--  <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yeah I basically invented the internet babe.</p>
            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh my god did you really? Wow you're amazing!</p> -->

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> So the first question is…Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</p>
            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Ok.</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> It can be like bulletpoints and then I can put it together?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So I look after all the technology of Sunnylife and related companies as in light Bullants and Manjo
It's a combination of dream work in house and then managing the relationship with our third party partners.

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> And relationships and management?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> The in-house work is mainly software related because that's where my skill is, and then all the technology and the security, and sorry the infrastructure and the security, and the internet and connectivity and that sort of stuff.
So the very technical stuff is managed. We outsource, and I manage the relationships with those partners.
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Ok, As well as managing the team?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yes, as well as managing the team.
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Please tell us about the industry you work in?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> This is the giftware, homeware…
You can do this one, you can answer this one…
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Hahaha yea, yes I can, i’ll answer that.
What other kinds of work do you have to do?
Business processes?
Tech support as well when you’re the only one in the office?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yep tech support, documentation, training.
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh yes?
What do you mean by documentation?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Like writing down instructions on how to do things.
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh ok, yep?
What other kinds of work?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Counselling
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh yea?
Hahaha, so that's across the office?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I guess since I've been at the company for so long, I know how to do most jobs. So, I'm generally the one people come to, to ask…
“how do I do something?”
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> How would we label that...office allrounder?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yes, office all rounder.
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Who are all the different people you would interact with, with your work?
Please tell us about them?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So I guess because it's a small company I deal with everyone in the company.
So from the warehouse Pickers and Packers through to the CEO and owners. Generally technology-related, often having to….
I guess adapt my language to suit their relative skill sets so most people I talk to are not technology people.


</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Yes that's one thing I noticed in jobs that are available. Especially in sales, is that you have to be able to communicate complicated technical kind of programs to someone who doesn't know what you're talking about?


</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So that's actually, probably, my…what I think is my greatest skill, is being able to sit between technical people and non-technical people. Effectively be bi-lingual

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Could you tell us about them?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So what specifically
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Who are all the different people you interact with in your work?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So if martine
So theres developers
And crews and everything

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Tech everything?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Tech everything
And then there’s always all the various business units.
So the sales team, the production team, the purchasing team I don't have much to do with…
What they do, it's more about how they do it. Most people I deal with I generally get impatient, frustrated
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> No fair call?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> And I think it's due to lack of understanding.
Most people I deal with are able to understand the problem and the requirements from their own point of view and not necessarily from…
Not necessarily how it impacts all the other teams and the rest of the business
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
This can be outside the business?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Ok
So I deal with non-technical people, so the account managers is that who we’re talking about? or just in my spare time?

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Yes, outside the business because we've already spoke about the ones within the team
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Ok, sure, what are they called…
Networking events?

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Yes, networking events?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I find most IT people to be substantially more technical than I am
And less business-oriented
I think in larger businesses IT people tend to be separated from the business operations so I don't have that much in common with them to be honest

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> So you don't know too many other people that work in IT?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I do know a few people that work in IT.
Mainly in sales. Not really technical people because my background is accounting, not IT, I don’t, or I’m not drawn towards…
I wouldn’t call myself a technologist, so I’m not interested in having a conversation about the latest innovations in security
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh, ok I didn’t realise that?
So you studied accounting?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I studied accounting, yea
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh wow?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I wouldn’t consider myself an IT nerd
Perhaps relative to everyone in the company om an IT nerd, but relative to IT people, they wouldn’t consider me an IT person

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> I’m writing that down because I find that really interesting?

How did you find yourself in IT then?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> My mother's a computer programmer so I've always had, or I was always the first of my friends to have a computer
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Your mum is a computer programmer? That's amazing! Wow, I’d love to know how she got started, but that will have to be for a different day?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Her and her best friend chose the course that had the highest male to female ratio
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Why?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> They thought that it would be a good way to meet guys
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Haha, you're kidding! Did she actually enjoy the course though and then the work?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yea, I mean she did it for forty years...so…
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh my god, that’s amazing. What a story!

So the IT sales people that you are sort of connected with now,…is that through the business?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> No, through socially but very few of them have IT backgrounds so when I think through the people who I'm friendly with socially who are in IT…
One is a lawyer and one is a salesman...so similar to you, like an account manager

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> What industry did they come in, or from?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> The account manager has always been in IT, but it has been in sales. IT/Sales, Software sales and the other the lawyer he works in IT. He is the head of procurement or something of IT, but he's a lawyer. So he spends his days reading through legal documents or contracts so he doesn't know what he's agreeing to…
Hes making sure that, so the technical person has signed off on the functionality, but he’s making sure that the contracts are all good

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh ok, got it.
And so the other sales person?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> He works for Microsoft, but his background has always been in sales and account management. Mainly sales.
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> What about your interaction with clients or investors?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I have no interactions with clients. The staff are my clients
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> It would be providers, but would you call them clients though? No, they’re providers?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> No, they’re suppliers
So, my clients are the people we do the work for, so our clients are the internal teams

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Staff are the clients?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> And it’s what I try and encourage Luke and Graham to always look at the team, the staff as your clients so when you reply to their emails you reply like you would reply to a client
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Yes
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yes be familiar with them, but don’t get frustrated at the drop of a hat
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?
Please tell us about these?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I would say the vast majority of my time is spent on well I would say two things firstly handling ...managing processes around exceptional events that occur
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Whoa, ok so?...
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So when something happens operationally in the business that is not a traditional transaction.
So we sell something to someone in a slightly different way
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Oh, ok, yep..
So, there was that danger last week for the hacking from what they thought was China?

Remember? in Australia, there was this danger around…?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yes...Yea, again so all that technical stuff, gets handled by our outsource company
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> So you weren’t directly related to this?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> No, so it didn’t impact us at all. It’s mainly…the vast majority of my work is around the business as opposed to the IT side of things
The manjo stock for example, how to incorporate that into the business stock. So that’s the one thing.
And The other thing is improving…
Helping the business run more efficiently ... getting more from less basically

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Improving business processes?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Improving business processes through technology
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Which then, once you have identified a new process, is that then outsourced or done within the team?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> It’s done within the team if we can...yea, correct
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> So that’s the two things you spend most of your time on…ok.

Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> The trade-offs between budgets, time and requirements

So…do you know about the triangle?
I think its called the project triangle where you've got time, cost and quality
Pick two

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Triangle, so you’ve got time cost and quality?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So you can never have all three
So, if you want something good, quickly, its going to cost you a lot of money
If you want something cheap, and quickly, its not going to be good (its going to be lacking quality)
If you want something quickly with good quality, its going to cost you a lot of money
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> What do you call this again?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> It’s got a name, I’ll find the name for you. I’ll email it to you
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Ok.
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> And it’s impossible to find an exception to it and we tend to…
In a small business, you tend to work with no time, everything’s urgent, you have no budget, but the requirements are very specific.
So, we don’t like to compromise on what it does generally speaking

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> One more thing trade-off between time budget requirements and everything is urgent…
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I'm managing outsourced partners making them or getting them to appreciate what is important for us.
And what’s important, and what’s urgent versus what’s not. So like the example you gave with your husbands second cousin. He appreciated how urgent it was, and to get someone who you have a professional relationship with to appreciate that, is quite a challenge.
They’ll tell you they can come in 4 hours which for them is dropping everything for you, buts its actually, or potentially not what you’re after.
So that, I find quite challenging

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Ok?  Finally, can you share an example of work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
That it is really just a lot to do with people?

</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> The essence of the IT industry
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> That’s a hard one isn’t it?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yea, cause very little of what I do is…
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> I mean…yea what is the essence of the IT industry?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> I think the essence of the IT industry is using technology to make people's lives easier
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Yes
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> So, technology is a means to an end. It's not an end in itself and I think most technologists forget that.
They get so caught up in the actual technology that they forget about what they actually needed to do, and whether, or what its replacing.
So I think the best example I can give, or a quick example is our server.
The way we’ve set up our servers and how we manage them where we have three servers in three locations replicating data so that any employee has access to any file immediately and locally in any location.
And that, I think captures the essences of the IT industry which is access to information and more easily and quickly than if it didn’t exist…if IT or the technology didn’t exist.

</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> So essence is access to information quickly?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Yep
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Through your three servers in your three locations that they can access at any time?
</p>

            <p class="rael"><b><u>Rael:</u></b> Correct
</p>

            <p class="joanne"><b><u>Joanne:</u></b> Cool, so we are running out of time, so we should finish up now.
Thank you Rael
